Important Notes:
*	This demo out-dated screen-shot from a much larger project I am (still)
	currently working on (Dungeon). This demo is still included because it 
	reached a point in development where it could be packaged up easily as
	a demonstration of coding principles and practices. For more in-depth
	and more complex (although unfinished )examples of what I have done in 
	Java, refer to the 'Dungeon' Repository.
	
*	This project was developmed and tested within Eclipse.
*	This project is dependant on the org.eclipse.swt package, and will not
	run otherwise.
*	swt.jar is included with the package (within the lib dir), it needs to
	be included on the build path.


General Notes about the project:
There were several goals I set for myself with this project
1) 	I enjoy the Diablo series and I wanted to get a feel for developing 
	something similar.
2)	I wanted to get experience with graphical packages. This includes
	contrasting between them. I was already familiar with Java and AWT,
	so I wanted to compare it to something different (yet similar, which
	would be easier to pick up). Hence, why I chose SWT.
3)	Wanted to get experience with porting projects across platforms
	or across UIs. This project would be the first step. I want to try
	and create something, that once the core game mechanics are stable,
	that will be able to have its UI replaced / updated easily.
4)	Sometimes I have an itch to program, and this scratches it.


Key Concepts covered:
This demo should be a good example of a range of practices:
--	Organization of code within classes and methods
--	Polymorphism & Inheritance
--	Good use of Object-oriented programing
--	Elegant solutions to problems (hopefully)
--	Protection (of class variables). On a need-to-know basis
		"Only those who need to know it, know about it."
--	Storage structure
--	Readability
--	Reusability of code
--	Mathematical logic.
--	Memory usage (SWT could eat up the system resources if used wrong)
	* So for once in Java, manual deallocation is important
