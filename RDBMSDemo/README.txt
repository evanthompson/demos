A demonstration of my knowledge of relational databases:
This example was a project completed in a relational database
management systems course. It was a group assignemnt, so I cannot take
full credit for this work.

Notes about the Project:
I would recommend just opening the .db2 file in a generic editor, instead of
trying to download, install, and run db2. The output of the db2script.db2
file can be found in the scriptoutput.txt document.

Queries are numbered, and match up between input and output files.

To get a quick overview of the size and complexity of the database, the
model that we based the database around can be found within the ERModel.pdf
file.


The project was done in visio and DB2.
